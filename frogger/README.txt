All the basic aspects/requirements of the assignment have been correctly implemented.
In addition,
    1) when the frog dies I render the dead_frog.png.
    2) the frogger sound is played in a loop.
    3) level progression is implemented.
    4) turtles are incorportated into the game.
    5) a fly randomly appears and gives 200 bonus points if eaten.

I collaborated with no one.
