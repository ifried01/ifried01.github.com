<h1>About Me</h1>
<!-- <p> is for paragraph, <strong> is for boldface -->
<p> I was born in Israel in 1992. I have lived in Israel, Switzerland, and California.<br/>
I am fluent in both English and Hebrew. I am majoring in Computer Science while concurrently <br/>
following a pre-medical path, and I am extremely interested in combining these two fields of study.<br/>

I have been a member of the Tufts University Men's Swimming and Diving Varsity team for <br/>
three years now.</p>
