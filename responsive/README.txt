I used an iPhone 4S.

Created an html page that displays different content based on the device
on which the page is open. 
On a computer screen, the page renders "No dice".
    - This is displayed because the laptop screen is greater than 1000px.
On an iPhone screen, the page renders "Dice".
    - This is displayed because the iPhone screen width is less than 670px.

I collaborated with no one.

Everything is implemented correctly to my knowledge.

Hours spent:
